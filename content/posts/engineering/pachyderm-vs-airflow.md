If you do a lot of data pipelining, you've probably heard a lot about Airflow by now. I gave a talk
about it a while back at a meetup, and wrote a blog post about it. The gist of my pitch for Airflow
was essentially *"Look, it's so much better than cron."*

Fast-forward a year or two, and my team is using Pachyderm now. This post is about why I wanted to try Pachyderm, 
what I love about it, and some of the tricks you'll need to know if you want to start using it.
