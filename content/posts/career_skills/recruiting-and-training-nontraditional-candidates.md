This is one of those posts, I'm writing it because I keep hearing people asking the same questions
over and over. I hear these questions at meetups and in Slack groups every week, and I hate seeing people 
trying to reinvent the wheel when it's really not necessary. 

* How come we don't have more women at our company? *

    * You haven't tried that hard. 
        - Try actively encouraging nontraditional candidates to apply. Reach out to people in your network and personally invite them. 
        Go to meetups, get involved in the communities. Help out by mentoring, be more visible. 
        
        - Try rewriting your job descriptions
            Textio is a nice idea, but it's not good enough. Textio and tools like it are not going to fix structural problems. 
            Think very hard about what you actually need. 
            Break out essential vs. nice-to-have skills. 
            Emphasize what process and support systems the company provides for candidates transitioning from other roles or fields. 
                - Do you have training and development stipends?
                - Do you send people to Grace Hopper every year? 
                - Do you have employee resource groups, or an inclusion squad? 
            Describe what candidates can expect in their first few months there.  
            
         - Try changing your interview process
            Your one-size-fits-all coding test never worked that well, you just didn't know it. 
            If you're doing things like setting a hard 20-minute limit on a particular problem, and rejecting candidates
            because they took 5 or 10 minutes longer to finish it, you're losing out on a lot of good candidates. 
            Rather than insisting on live coding tests as teleconferences with Coderpad, consider offering a take-home option instead. 
            If you're offering a pairing exercise, train your interviewers in how to pair productively. 

                  
** Training Junior or Nontraditional Candidates **

Not all nontraditional candidates are really junior, but most of us have gaps. I had a lot of transferrable skills
when I first started in software, but I didn't know what they all were. I knew some of the things I hadn't done yet,
but there were also plenty of things I didn't know that I didn't know. There still are. 

I’ve trained a LOT of junior people, starting from way back in my scientific career, and my process is basically this: 

a) Train the first one of each cohort well, so they can help train the ones who join later

b) Write everyfuckingthing down, so they can look shit up instead of asking me. Encourage them to improve the documentation
 as they use it. The more people who contribute, the better your instructions will be. 
 
 I have a terrible memory, so I prefer written instructions
 to verbal, and I take notes whenever anyone is telling me how to do something. I encourage everyone who works with me to do the same. 
 
 The kinds of things that are useful to have written down:
    Onboarding:
        How to set up your computer with access to all the services/databases/software they will need.
        Where to find information (Confluence, JIRA, google docs folders, etc)
        Who to ask about what - for example, who owns what repos

 For a data science team:
    - where the databases are
    - data dictionaries for each one
    - instructions for any infrastructure (AWS, ETL tools, etc.)
    
c) Give them smaller, discrete projects to start with. Things that you know will result in quick wins easily. Then start
adding harder projects that let them build on what they know, and/or use their transferrable skills (e.g. if you hired a 
statistics expert, give her some analysis to do while she's also getting up to speed on writing production code). 

d) Once they've been there a little while, be a little bit unavailable sometimes, so they can start doing things on their own. 
Don’t be afraid to tell them to look on stackoverflow/try a little more before they start bugging you 

d) Focus on teaching them how to teach themselves, because that’s a more transferrable skill anyway.

This one can be tricky. If you're hiring mostly PhDs, some will already have very mature self-teaching skills, but 
not everyone does. Or they'll be overwhelmed by adjusting to the culture shock of a new environment. 

**Leveling up**

I think the main difference between junior and senior is knowing what’s known/been done before, and what’s really novel or unique to your system. This is true in science and in software. 

Senior people usually have a better grasp of what’s available and where to look for resources. 

Really good senior people always look around first before reinventing the wheel, and even if they have to do something novel, they look for related things to build from and inform their process.

The second difference between junior and senior people is that junior people typically spend a huge amount of energy doubting themselves and second-guessing every move they make. Senior people have usually had more experience with failing and surviving failure, so you have to make everyone feel psychologically safe. They have to know that even if they screw up, it will probably cost some time, and it might even cost some money, but it's probably not going to cost anyone their job if they screw up once in a while.
