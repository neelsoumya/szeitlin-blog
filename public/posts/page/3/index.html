      Here is a story about an interesting interview question and how I approached it.
The company in question wasn&rsquo;t interested in actually looking at my code, since I apparently tried to answer the wrong question.
 Given a deck of n unique cards, cut the deck c cards from the top and perform a perfect shuffle. A perfect shuffle is where you put down the bottom card from the top portion of the deck followed by the bottom card from the bottom portion of the deck.

      A couple of weeks ago, I had a pleasant interview. Here&rsquo;s what was different about that interview, that made it really stand out from the others I&rsquo;ve done.
 The hiring manager contacted me directly He had done his homework. He had looked at my GitHub repos. He told gave me pretty specific information about the structure of the interview, and gave me ~2 weeks to prepare. The interview was 1-on-1, in person.

      When to test, and why: • Write a test for every method.
• Write a test any time you find a bug! Then make sure the test passes after you fix the bug.
• Think of tests as showing how your code should be used, and write them accordingly. The next person who&rsquo;s going to edit your code, or even just use your code, should be able to refer to your tests to see what&rsquo;s happening.

      Why Spark? Lately I have been working on a project that requires cleaning and analyzing a large volume of event-level data.
Originally, I did some exploratory data analysis on small samples of data (up to 15 million rows) using pandas, my usual data visualization tools, and multiprocessing. But then it was time to scale up.
Why Spark is good for this Distributed processing means it&rsquo;s very fast at very large scale, and we can scale it up with minimal adjustments (the same code still works, we just need a bigger cluster).

      In an effort to advance my python skills, I’ve been slowly pecking away at the puzzles on pythonchallenge. I’ve gotten stuck on most of the challenges, and either had to search for a hint, or ask for help from a friend, or both. This latest one was particularly instructive, and it had to do with zipfiles.
I thought I knew what zip files were. I have used them since grad school, for transferring folders via email, and for compression.

      I know that from the outside, &lsquo;science&rsquo; seems like The Place Where Scientists Live. But &lsquo;science&rsquo; is not a monolithic, homogenous thing. Not all scientists are the same.
Today someone called me a Biologist. But I was never really a Biologist. My undergraduate degree was in a chemistry department.
My past life as a researcher was always very interdisciplinary. To better understand cancer cells, I used a lot of sophisticated software, and mathematical intuition, in addition to chemistry and physics.

      Lately I&rsquo;ve been attending a lot of technical (read: software) talks. And I recently attended PyData, which was held at Facebook. I&rsquo;ve noticed at all of these events that the quality of presentations varies widely.
If you&rsquo;re like me, and you go to technical meetups and conferences around the Bay Area, for example, you&rsquo;ll notice that some talks are well-rehearsed.
But some seem like they were thrown together at the last minute.

      I don&rsquo;t believe truth is a finite value. Truth is what we know right now. Every ten years or so, a major discovery gets overturned. Scientists are just people, and we&rsquo;re wrong a lot.
So one of the scariest things about doing research, or predictions, is trying to convince yourself, and other people, that what you think you&rsquo;ve discovered is &lsquo;real&rsquo;.
Or at least real enough, right now, to be believable.

      Things I learned while following this tutorial on how to build reusable models with scikit-learn.
 When in doubt, go back to pandas. When in doubt, write tests. When in doubt, write helper methods to wrap existing objects, rather than creating new objects.  Ingesting &ldquo;clean&rdquo; data is easy, right? Step 1 of this tutorial began with downloading data using requests, and saving that to a csv file. So I did that.
