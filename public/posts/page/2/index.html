      This post is about a couple of painful problems I&rsquo;ve had recently with reading in text files.
They&rsquo;re just text files, right? What could be hard about that?
1. Fun with encoding The problem:
A friend sent me a dump of data from iTunes, as a table.
Just a text file.
She&rsquo;s on a Mac. I&rsquo;m on a Mac. But when I went to read in the file, Python choked in a way I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.

      So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re thinking about attending a conference in tech, or some STEM field.
Maybe you&rsquo;ll be going alone. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never been to a conference before, or this conference has a reputation for having, shall we say, &ldquo;a higher risk of harassment&rdquo;.
Here&rsquo;s a &lsquo;game plan&rsquo; for things to keep in mind. I&rsquo;m not saying anyone should have to do this, I&rsquo;m saying this is more or less what I did when I was younger and had to go to STEM meetings, usually alone, and didn&rsquo;t always feel safe.

      Thanks to a friend who wants to help more women get into tech careers, last year I attended Developer Week, where I was impressed by a talk about Neo4j.
Graph databases excited me right away, since this is a concept I&rsquo;ve used for brainstorming since 3rd grade, when my teachers Mrs. Nysmith and Weaver taught us to draw webbings as a way to take notes and work through logic puzzles.

      In continuing my series on investigating bike data, I ran into some interesting aspects of working with device data.
I have some experience with devices, thanks to my many years of working in research labs. This post is about the fun of hunting down what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not.
Things to consider when working with devices  Are you using the device yourself? Are you interacting with the user(s) (directly or indirectly)?

      In a previous post, I wrote about using probability binning to create categories out of numerical data. This simplifying approach works well on various kinds of distributions.
In this post, I wanted to show an example of how well it can work.

      Recently, I&rsquo;ve done a few data science coding challenges for job interviews. My favorite ones included a data set and asked me to address both specific and open-ended questions about that data set.
One of the first things I usually do is make a bunch of histograms. Histograms are great because it&rsquo;s an easy way to look at the distribution of data without having to plot every single point, or get distracted by a lot of noise.

      I&rsquo;ve spent the last year learning Python. A lot of people have asked me where to begin. Here&rsquo;s a guide to what I found useful (or not) and why.
 Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-  I started here. I did the free online version.
I like the advice he gives you to just type things in, even if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening yet. This required a bit of an adjustment to my usual mindset, where I question everything all the time.

      Recently I looked at a couple of data sets that involved geographical data. I wanted to actually plot the data on a map, so I had to do some shopping around for easy ways to do this quickly with python.
What I wanted to do One of the data sets provided zipcodes, which I was able to convert to latitude and longitude (more on this below). At a minimum, I knew I wanted to be able to plot: a) location, b) a number value and text label, c) multiple colors designating groups of data points, e.

      Last week I did a technical interview for which I was underprepared. I feel like no matter how much I try to prepare, I am always underprepared for technical interviews.
In this case, I was underprepared for a few reasons, including:
a) It was the first interview where I&rsquo;ve been asked to write more than a couple lines of recursive code
b) in front of 3 people
c) For some reason, for this position, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that I was meeting with the software team and doing a technical interview of that sort at all.

      Inspired by a couple of great posts by Michael Gibson, I want to talk about what robustness means to me, as someone coming from a science background.
I started working in a &ldquo;wetlab&rdquo; doing benchwork cancer research when I was in high school (I was 16). I learned early on that mistakes are:
 normal avoidable necessary.  That may sound paradoxical, so I&rsquo;ll explain. Some failures will always happen: the phone rings and you drop something.
