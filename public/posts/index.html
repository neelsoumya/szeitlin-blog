      Almost exactly a year ago, I joined Yahoo, which more recently became Oath.
The team I joined is called the Product Hackers, and we work with large amounts of data. By large amounts I meant, billions of rows of log data.
Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS.

      Recently, a friend recruited me to do some technical writing for the company where he works now. Basically, they needed someone to quickly revise and update the documentation for their software.
Most modern user-friendly software documentation isn&rsquo;t just writing, though. It&rsquo;s screenshots. A LOT of screenshots. So you don&rsquo;t just write &ldquo;click on the blue box&rdquo;, you also show a picture of it, like this. See the blue box?

      Last month, I was looking for some fun time series data to hack on. Turns out bike computers provide a great way to interface between your friends&rsquo; unfounded modesty and their actual rides.
One friend was kind enough to donate some data for my entertainment. This friend wears spandex, rides a titanium frame road bike, and sweats a lot. I knew he was a strong cyclist. He&rsquo;s also relatively consistent, which meant the data he gave me wasn&rsquo;t too terribly noisy.

      So I have some bike data that I parsed out of XML and put into a pandas dataframe. Most of the questions I wanted to ask required that the timestamp of each ride segment, or lap, be used as the index along the x-axis of a plot.
Non-obvious nuances of pandas datetime objects and indexes. You have to sort the dataframe by timestamps, before you can convert the timestamps to use as an index.

      One thing I wanted to do with this data set was experiment with plotting methods. I had already done some exploratory plotting with regular matplotlib, so I had some vague ideas about what I wanted to do.
First I had to select out subsets of data to compare. I knew that there were two types of rides: shorter trips in the city, and longer trips in the suburbs. I was feeling lazy, so I just did a quick threshold with SQL.

      One of the main reasons this project turned out to be interesting is that time series data has all kinds of gotchas. I never had to deal with a lot of this before, because the sorts of time series I did in my scientific life didn&rsquo;t care about real-life things like time zones. We mostly just cared about calculating time elapsed.

Anyway one thing I wondered about with the bike data was, can we compare average speeds in the morning vs.

      Am I getting slower every day?
If you&rsquo;ve ever been a bike commuter, you&rsquo;ve probably asked yourself this question. Thanks to these little devices we can now attach to ourselves or our bicycles, we can now use our own actual ride data to investigate these kinds of questions, as well as questions like these:
 If I&rsquo;m going to work from home one day a week, which day would maximize my recovery?

      For better or worse, when you&rsquo;re dealing with data pipelines of varying shapes and sizes, sometimes you need to combine objects that don&rsquo;t match up evenly.
For example, if you want to apply a condition via lookup, sometimes it makes sense to just do a merge. This creates a new column in your data table, and then you can use that for reference.
This is an extremely simple example to show what I mean:

      A lot of people have asked me why I&rsquo;m not working in academia or biotech, how I learned to code, or how I got into data science. Here are some answers to some of those questions.
 Are you sure you wouldn&rsquo;t rather be in academia?
 Yes and no.
Yes, I wanted my own lab. No, we don&rsquo;t always get what we want, even after 7 years of postdoc.
